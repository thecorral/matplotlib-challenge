The study compared the efficacy of four different drug regimens in reducing tumor growth in mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The drug regimens included Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Over a 45-day period, tumor volume was measured and recorded.

The results showed that the Capomulin regimen was the most effective in reducing tumor growth, as mice treated with Capomulin had the smallest average tumor volume at the end of the treatment period. Additionally, the survival rate of mice treated with Capomulin was higher than those treated with the other three drug regimens.

Further analysis showed a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume, indicating that heavier mice tended to have larger tumors. However, there was no significant difference in tumor volume between male and female mice.

Overall, these results suggest that Capomulin may be an effective treatment for SCC in mice and warrants further investigation in clinical trials.
